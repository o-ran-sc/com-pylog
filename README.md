Mdclogpy
========

Structured logging library with Mapped Diagnostic Context

* Outputs the log entries to standard out in structured format, json currently.
* Severity based filtering.
* Supports Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC).
  Set MDC pairs are automatically added to log entries by the library.


Log entry format
----------------

Each log entry written with mdclog_write() function contains

* Timestamp
* Logger identity
* Log entry severity
* All existing MDC pairs
* Log message text

Currently the library only supports JSON formatted output written to standard
out of the process.

*Example log output*

`{"ts": 1559285893047, "crit": "INFO", "id": "myprog", "mdc": {"second key":"other value","mykey":"keyval"}, "msg": "Hello world!"}`

Install
-------

Install from PyPi

```
python3 -m pip install mdclogpy
```

Install using the source

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Usage
-----

The library can be used in two ways shown below.

1) Use the root logger

```python
  import mdclogpy
  mdclogpy.error("This is an error log")
```

2) Create a logger instance

```python
  from mdclogpy import Logger
  my_logger = Logger()
  my_logger.error("This is an error log")
```

A program can create several logger instances.


Mapped Diagnostics Context
--------------------------

The MDCs are logger instance specific key-value pairs, which are included to
all log entries written via the logger instance.

By default, the library implements a root logger instance.
MDCs added to the root logger instance are added only to the log entries
written via the root logger instance.

Unit testing
------------

To run the unit tests run the following command in the package directory::
`
python3 -m unittest discover
`

CI
--

The `ci` directory contains a Docker file that, when built, runs the unit tests for the repository.
It does not publish anything. Publishing a pypi version of the library is done manually
as it requires giving a password.
